# What is this?
This is my personal nix pkgs overlay. I put all the extra packages I want to deploy on my systems here. 
Almost like my own little software repo. 

# How to use it
Simply add this flake to your config as an overlay.

Import flake:
```nix
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs.url = "nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
    nixpkgs-overlay.url = "github:stoek/stixoverlay";
  };
```

Example from my nix config:
```
    allPkgs = lib.mkPkgs { 
      inherit nixpkgs; 
      cfg = { allowUnfree = true; };
      overlays = [
        nixpkgs-overlay.overlay
      ];
    };

```
